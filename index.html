            <h2>THIRD TIME'S THE CHARM</h2>
            <p>
                Happy third anniversary!!!! This website was created to commemorate three years of meaningful growth and success of our relationship. 
                The journey has not been easy and we have been through so many life-changing experiences. 
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                <!-- first year -->
                On the first year, I'm thankful that you came into my life. You're the light, the joy and the source of my happiness. First year was full of adventure, exploration and trying new things
                together. I still remember our very first date at snow city and how you looked so cute in the winter jacket and red boots. Though you were little shy, thank you for taking the initiative to 
                make the first move. It was amazing and words simply can't describe how I felt when you first held my hand. As a cheesy as it sounds, it felt like butterflies exploded in my stomach.               
                Getting to know you phase was smooth and I'm glad that on this year, I introduced you to Jinjja chicken, which soon became our number one source of addiction. 
                First year was full of joy and laughter, lots and lots of hugs and love. 
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                <!-- second year -->
                Second year was transitive journey for us. I'm sure everyone could agree that being NS girlfriend is not an easy feat. Imagine only meeting your loved one
                only on the weekends in person. Though it was a tough 3 + 4 months initially, we manage to pull it through by spending our tiny windows of free-time to 
                communicate and catch-up with life. Things got much better after I got posted to unit. I'm glad that I could fully utilise that 2 days off to spend time 
                and explore the world (boon-lay) with you. Quality prata has undoubtedly the best prata kosong and the stall will forever be missed. Thank you for constantly
                waking up and sending me to work at harbour front and wishing me well for my every duty, I really appreciate it. 
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                <!-- third year -->
                Honestly, third year was the hardest phase for us. Obstacles, new expectations to meet and yet another change of pace from NS to the university life. 
                With the busy schedule, I'm sorry that I struggled to keep up to do the bare minimum and treat you the way you deserved. In the spirit of growth, I
                will always be supportive in what we do and I always have faith in you to be a successful person. I am so proud of your achievements so far and not surprised 
                given your quick ability to learn and how well-spkoen you are, I trust that you will achieve you next milestone with ease. Furthermore, this year was the year where covid 
                hit the hardest too. Despite the obstacles, I feel that this year is detrimental to our long-term growth of the relationship. This year is the time where we could 
                learn from our mistakes and compromise each others' flaws. Thank you for taking care of you and I could only do the same 

                After all, there is always bitter in everyday but the world is less bitter with you around.
            </p>
             
            <br>

            <p>
                Last but not least, thank you for sticking by my side through thick and thin and putting all the hard work to keep our relationship in check. 
                P.s. flower will one day die but digitally, it'll be kept forever - as long as the website is not down :P. 
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>I love you paap, always ❤️.</p>
